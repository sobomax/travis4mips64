# Welcome to Travis4Mips64 Project


## About

This is my experiments to see if we can use QEMU user-mode emulation to build
MIPS64 code and run it for Fun & Profit [tm] in less than say 50 lines of
Travis code.

## Why MIPS64?

Mostly because it's the only Big Endian architecture with strong ordering
requirements in existence today.
